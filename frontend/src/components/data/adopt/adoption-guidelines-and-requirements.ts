  'OFF-LEASH AND INVISIBLE FENCE POLICY - We understand that some of the best adopters do not have fenced yards. Unlike some rescues, we do not impose the rule that adopters must have fenced yards to adopt. Dachshunds are, by breed definition, scent hounds. They will often go into hunting mode, zoning out their humans. For their own protection, the majority of LPDR dogs will need to be adopted into home environments that allow them to run free in securely fenced areas or with people who are devoted to leash walking. Please understand that there is a subset of dogs that do not deal well leashed and will only be adoptable to applicants with fenced yards.',
  `It is LPDR's position that invisible fences are not suitable for dachshunds for several reasons. Dachshunds are known for protecting their humans and others they view as part of their pack. Invisible fences pose two large problems. First, a dachshund may chase something out of the yard as they are prey driven and they will run right through the invisible fence only to realize that the associated collar zap hurt, thus preventing them from returning to their yard as they do not want to feel that pain again. Second, invisible fences serve to keep your dog in, but do not keep your pet safe from other dogs or wild animals entering those reasons, it will be uncommon that we adopt to people who utilize invisible fences.`,
  `USE OF DOGGY DOOR - Homes with Doggy Doors must show proof of a securely fenced yard. LPDR must confirm that someone will watch over one of our dogs when outside and not let the dog have unsupervised use of an open doggy door, to make sure the door is closed at night. We have had instances where dogs were within their securely fenced yard and required immediate veterinary care. First, a woodchuck somehow entered the fenced area and attacked one of our dogs. Secondly, one of our dogs was stung by a bee and swelled up. Fortunately, these were both instances where the dog owners were home to care for them. A lot of thought has gone into our decision to not place our dogs in homes where they will be left unattended in their backyard.`,
