        It is LPDRâ€™s goal to identify abandoned, mistreated, or homeless dogs
        and oversee their treatment and wellbeing while working to find loving
        owners for those in our care. If you are looking for a new family
        member, take a look at our available dachshund and dachshund mixes.
