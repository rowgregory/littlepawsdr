      text: "Tina was rescued from euthanasia and came to LPDR in rough condition. She was loaded with heart worms, missing fur, had infected skin lesions, and was malnourished. The worms severely damaged her heart. After one year of heart worm treatment and now daily medication with a prescription diet, Tina has been a love for almost 4 years. Tina relies on donations for her medical care, diapering supplies, and daily medications. Tina is living a life full with love from her foster family.",

      img: Coco,
      text: "Cocoâ€™s owners surrendered him to the shelter just after his 14th birthday. LPDR rescued sweet Coco just three days later.  Coco was in terrible shape when he was rescued. Vet records recommended amputation of his tail due to severe flea dermatitis as he was chewing it off.  His owners declined treatment.  Now he only has a nub for a tail.  Due to severe neglect, Coco also suffered from severe dental disease.  During a routine dental cleaning, Coco sustained a jaw fracture which required a plate to be inserted.  Unfortunately, his body rejected the plate and it had to be removed along with part of his lower jaw.  LPDR thought he was rallying from this major ordeal, but then he developed dry eye.  His foster mom tried managing the eye for over a month, but the best course of treatment for Coco was to remove his left eye.  To top it all off, sweet Coco also has a heart murmur. Coco takes monthly heart worm preventative, and must be on a prescription canned food for his sensitive GI. Now in safety and receiving the love and care he needs, Coco is quite content with lots of blankets to burrow under and food to fill his belly!",

      text: "Toby came to LPDR as an owner surrendered, who was malnourished and heart worm positive. Toby required a dental cleaning which resulted in multiple extractions. Toby underwent heart worm treatment and is no longer positive! Unfortunately, he had a severe case of heart worms that damaged his heart causing him to intermittently fall ill and require vetting. Toby most enjoys playing with toys in his foster home.",
