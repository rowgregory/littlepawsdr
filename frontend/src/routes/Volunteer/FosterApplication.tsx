                Fostering is our transitional step from a shelter/surrender to a
                forever home. During this time itâ€™s important that we give each
                dachshund a safe environment where it can learn to trust again,
                to heal and to learn how to become a loving family member. Many
                of the dachshunds that we pull from shelters or receive from an
                owner surrender just need a temporary home until their new
                furever home can be found.

                It is the responsibility of the foster parent to provide the
                dachshund(s) with food, monthly flea/tick medication, training
                and love. The rescue will provide a handbook on all policy and
                procedures, pay for all vetting care (as outlined in the
                handbook), monthly heartworm preventative, education and
                support.

                Once we receive your application, we will contact your vet and
                personal references. After you have passed those criteria's we
                will ask a volunteer to set up a time for a homevisit. A
                homevisit volunteer will come to your home and look at the
                places that a foster dog will eat, play and sleep. We require
                that everyone in your home be present at the time of the
                homevisit.

                Fostering is a rewarding experience but is a commitment for any
                person. You will be asked to bring home a dog that may have just
                been pulled out of the shelter into your home or one that was
                surrendered by their owner. Some fosters do not get along with
                your dogs while others will warm up very quickly. There will be
                some that are sick and will need your attention. But the reward
                when they go to their forever home is something you will never
                forget.
