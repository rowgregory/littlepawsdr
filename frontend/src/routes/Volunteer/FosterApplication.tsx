          Fostering is our transitional step from a shelter/surrender to a
          forever home.

          During this time itâ€™s important that we give each dachshund a safe
          environment where it can learn to trust again, to heal and to learn
          how to become a loving family member. Many of the dachshunds that we
          pull from shelters or receive from an owner surrender just need a
          temporary home until their new furever home can be found.

          After you have passed those criteria's we will ask a volunteer to set
          up a time for a homevisit. A homevisit volunteer will come to your
          home and look at the places that a foster dog will eat, play and
          sleep. We require that everyone in your home be present at the time of
          the homevisit.

          LPDR is responsible for all vetting for foster dogs. We will also
          provide you with a handbook to answer many of your questions about our
          foster policies and procedures.

          Fostering is a rewarding experience but is a commitment for any
          person. You will be asked to bring home a dog that may have just been
          pulled out of the shelter into your home or one that was surrendered
          by their owner. Some fosters do not get along with your dogs while
          others will warm up very quickly. There will be some that are sick and
          will need your attention. But the reward when they go to their forever
          home is something you will never forget.
