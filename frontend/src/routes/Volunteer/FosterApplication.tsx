        Fostering is our transitional step from a shelter/surrender to a forever
        home. During this time itâ€™s important that we give each dachshund a safe
        environment where it can learn to trust again, to heal and to learn how
        to become a loving family member. Many of the dachshunds that we pull
        from shelters or receive from an owner surrender just need a temporary
        home until their new furever home can be found.

        It is the responsibility of the foster parent to provide the
        dachshund(s) with food, monthly flea/tick medication, training and love.
        The rescue will provide a handbook on all policy and procedures, pay for
        all vetting care (as outlined in the handbook), monthly heartworm
        preventative, education and support.

        Once we receive your application, we will contact your vet and personal
        references. After you have passed those criteria's we will ask a
        volunteer to set up a time for a homevisit. A homevisit volunteer will
        come to your home and look at the places that a foster dog will eat,
        play and sleep. We require that everyone in your home be present at the
        time of the homevisit.

        LPDR is responsible for all vetting for foster dogs. We will also
        provide you with a handbook to answer many of your questions about our
        foster policies and procedures.

        Fostering is a rewarding experience but is a commitment for any person.
        You will be asked to bring home a dog that may have just been pulled out
        of the shelter into your home or one that was surrendered by their
        owner. Some fosters do not get along with your dogs while others will
        warm up very quickly. There will be some that are sick and will need
        your attention. But the reward when they go to their forever home is
        something you will never forget.
